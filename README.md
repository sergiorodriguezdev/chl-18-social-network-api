# Challenge 18 - Social Network API

## Project Description

Your new social network project should be supported on the backend by a reliable solution using the latest technologies as this will help you scale in the future. This API provides you with the endpoints to get you started.

This API is powered by MongoDB and the `mongoose` library allows us to connect to a MongoDB database and create models to support the different functionality required.

NoSQL is a new concept to me but having used relational databases extensively in the past made it easy to grasp and implement the solution.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
